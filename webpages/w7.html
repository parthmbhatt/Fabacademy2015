<h2>Making a table</h2>
<p> For this weeks assignment we had to design and make something big, I decided to try my hand at making a table.   </p> 
<p>here's the design file on solidworks:</p>

<p>and the dwg file for milling</p>
<img src="images/tablecut.JPG">
<p> I parametrcially bound the legs so they would be slaved to any changed in design to the two levels</p>

<p>Unfortunately I forgot to take photographs of the process of milling and separating the parts from the sheet , so here are the parts</p>

<p>and the final assembly</p>

<h2>Making an airframe</h2>

<p>Since I couldn't get good enough documentation on the table I decided to document another project I've been working on, which is the manufacture of an airframe. Below, I've shown the model view of that the aircraft would look like once completed</p>
<img src="images/planetopview.jpg">
<img src="images/planeisometric.jpg">
<p> the material I used for this purpose was extruded polystyrene, 30mm thick, which has a very nice consistency and cuts like butter. Here you can see the cut file I used:</p>
<img src="images/planecut.JPG">
<p>The bit I selected initially (for higher accuracy) was a 1/8" 4 fluted, spiral endmill. this turned out to be a mistake as i later found out, because the cutting edge of the bit was only 12mm in length. Consequently, when the bit started cutting deeper than that, its shaft started rubbing against the XPS and melting it onto the bit untill the bit itself was no longer in contact with the material due to the coating of melted plastic on it</p>
<img src="images/plane7.jpg">
<p>to rectify this I selected a 1/4" 4 fluted, spiral endmill with a much longer cutting edge as shown below</p>
<img src="images/plane9.jpg">
<p>after a few tests it became apparent that going slowly would lead to melted plastic and much grief, so I completed the cut at 6 in/s and in one pass (30mm depth) The material was anchored to the spoil board using industrial grade double sided tape</p>
<img src="images/plane10.jpg">
<p>It is impotrant to note that when doing such cuts, it is imperative to leave tabs or else the parts can move around and get damaged. once I had the parts out, all that was left was assembly </p>
<p></p>

<img src="images/plane2.jpg">
<p>at this stage I mainly wanted to test for structural integrity and rigiditym which it seemed to be lacking. to fix this, I added two sets of cross beams under the frame</p>
<img src="images/plane6.jpg">
<p>This milling job also involved making a pocket cut, as the horizontal stabilizers could not be allowed to be 30mm thick</p>
<img src="images/plane3.jpg">
<p>The finish of the surface is actually remarkably good, considering I was moving at such high speeds</p>
