<h2>The Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of this weeks assignment is to figure out the following things about our final projects:



      what will it do?
      who's done what beforehand?
      what materials and components will be required?
      where will they come from?
      how much will it cost?
      what parts and systems will be made?
      what processes will be used?
      what tasks need to be completed?
      what questions need to be answered?
      what is the schedule?
      how will it be evaluated?
   projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the skills
   where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project</p>

<h2>what will it do?</h2>
<p>My project hasnt changed much since the start, (except that instead of a mechanical firing system I'll be using an electronagnetic one). I'll be attempting to build an automatic 2DOF coilgun turret. 
what this Implies is: 
<ul>
<li>it will be able to aim in the X and Y axes</li>
<li>it will be able to fire non- lethal(ferromagnetic) projectiles up to a certain distance (10 feet is my current goal)</li>
<li>It will be able to fire the projectile with varying power</li>
<li>it will be able to select targets (this is pushing it slightly)</li>
<li>It will be mounted on a moving platform, effectively forming a sort of toy tank (this is pushing it a lot)</li>

</ul></p>

<h2>who's done what beforehand?</h2>
<p> there are several such projects on sites such as  <a href="http://projectsentrygun.rudolphlabs.com/">this</a> or <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Autonomous-Paintball-Sentry-Gun/">this</a> or even <a href="http://hackedgadgets.com/2010/05/16/wifi-controlled-coil-gun-turret/">this</a></p> 
<img src="">
<h2>what materials and components will be required?</h2>
<p>As of now, after having dug around for similar projects, I've come upon an informal list of sub-systems and their components:
<ul>
<li><strong>The movement system:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A two axis mount for the servos (that will also hold the coil)</li>
<li>two servo motors</li>
<li>two servo drivers</li>
<li>a physical user interfacre to control the servos (ideally using 4 butons on a board)</li>
<li>a means to zero or calibrate the servo positions every time i use the system</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>The firing system</strong>
<ul>
<li>A plastic tube</li>
<li>Magnet wire</li>
<li>An iron bolt almost the size of the tube</li>
<li>a high power switch, such as a relay switch, or a thyristor</li>
<li>Diodes, to make sure the current doesnt flow the wrong way and wreck something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The variable power delivery system</strong>
<ul>
<li>Capacitor bank</li>
<li>full bridge rectifier</li>
<li>charging circuit</li>
<li>voltage readout</li>
<li>a safe enclosure to avoid death/injury</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the targetting system</strong> (note this is a stretch and I honestly haven't given it too much thought)
<ul>
<li>a camera or simpler sensor (maybe just ultrasound)</li>
<li>a board that identifies targets</li>
<li>Code defining targetting parameters</li>
<li>interface with the servos</li>


</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>where will they come from?</h2>
<p>Most of my components can and will be made using the resources available within the fablab. I will have to purchase capacitors from local electronics shops, along with the bolts that will come from local hardware shops. The enclosure and embodiment will be made using laser cut acrylic</p>
<img src="">
<img src="">
<h2>how much will it cost?</h2>
<p>I estimate the cost to be a few thousand ruppees I'm allowing myself a maximum of Rs 5000), which roughly equates to $80 though I highly doubt I'll even get past $40   </p>
<h2>what parts and systems will be made?</h2>
<p>the list of parts/ systems I will be making myself are"
<ul>
<li>The capacitor bank</li>
<li>the coil apparatus</li>
<li>the dual bridge rectifier</li>
<li>the servo mounts </li>
<li>all the boards involved</li>
</ul>
</p>
<img src="">
<h2>what processes will be used?</h2>
<p>I expect to use the following processes learnt throughout the duration of the class:
<ul>
<li>CAD (to design the parts)</li>
<li>Computer aided cutting (to cut out the parts designed)</li>
<li>Electronics design( for the rectifier and the logic boards</li>
<li>Electronics production (to fabricate the boards)</li>
<li>Output devices( to control the servos)</li>
<li>Input devices ( to get feedback on the level of charge in the capacitors)</li>
<li>Embedded programming ( to program the boards to act the way I need them to)</li>
</ul></p>
<img src="">
<h2>what tasks need to be completed?</h2>
<p>As of now, the tasks I have to get done are (broadly):
<ul>
<li>Build the servo mount and controls</li>
<li>build the coil mechanism so it atually fires a projectile</li>
<li>build a physical interface so I dont need to hook it up to the computer every time</li>

</ul>


</p>
<img src="">
<h2>what questions need to be answered?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The technical specifications of the coil gun itself</li>
<li>the algorithm I'll use to control the steppers</li>
<li>the means of charging, and discharging quickly, and before the projectile reaches the centre of the coil</li>
<li>the means of switching the power safely</li>
<li>The method by wich I can auto-home the servos if needed</li>

</ul><p>

</p>
<img src="">
<h2>what is the schedule?</h2>
<p>I'm still working on a schedule, right now I'm working at it in a haphazard fashion, I'll have to change that</p>
<img src="">
<h2>how will it be evaluated?</h2>
<p>It will be evaluated on its ability to :
<ul>
<li>move the turret in two axes</li>
<li>Fire a projectile to a minimum distance</li>
<li>Do this with some degree of repeatability</li>
<li>(stretch) Auto target</li>
</ul>
