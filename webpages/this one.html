<h2>Website Design</h2>
<p>I'm very new to website design, the only thing I remember from my school days is the 'marquee' tag, which I've so proudly used. the rest I've learnt slowly and tediously under the patient tutelage of our fablab instructor <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/skupniewicz.henry/">Henry.</a></li></p>

<p>At first my text was really wide but with a little basic CSS I managed to make it look a little neat, what I've done is created margins to the right . sure, my space is wasted but at least the page doesn't make me feel tired and irritated like <a href=""></a>this one</p>
<p> I've found the &ltp&gt tag really useful when it comes to ogranising things </p>
<p>one</p>
<p>below</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>other</p>

<p>Another feature that I was really excited to use was the fixed sidbar, I tried using the Float tag to make it work but I could never quite get it, so I cheated a little and created a div "sidebar" , fixed its position at 10px ,100px, and then put a 600px left margin on the body.</p>
	<p><i>(if its stupid and it works, it ain't stupid)</i></p>
<p>I wanted to have a background image for my index page but it was too dark. I looked everywhere trying to make it transparent but I gave up and used Illustrator in the end</p>
	<p>for anyone starting out with HTML, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"> Sublime Text Editor</a> . It give you prompts for he tags so you dont have to remember or reference every tag. also check out <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3school's</a></p> HTML Tutorial. Its very newbie friendly

<h2>Final project Idea</h2>
<h3>1.automated slingshot/catapault</h3>
<p>I think it would be interesting to create an automated catapault or slingshot, one that would take input in the form of how long and how high the projectile needs to go, and would then accordingly set the angle and tension on the spring/sling. The projectile would have to be standard, maybe a marble (a circular object is always preferrable due to the simpicity of its viscous nature) </p>
<p>The launching mechanism could be in the form of a wooden channel with a sliding piston powered by a spring and drawn back by a stepper motor, the tension could be measured using a strain guage or simply by noting the revolutions of the stepper, but the spring would have to be operated strictly in its linear elasticity range  </p>
<p>The angle and speed can be set using the equations of projectile motion, as the mass of the projectile would be standard</p>
